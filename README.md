## Patch 1 (17/03/2019): 

* Kexploit is now fixed and updated to PoC exploit
* The HTML file is removed 

## Patch 2 (26/03/2019):

* HTML is added (Now It Works) 


## Issues

* HTML doesn’t work beacause it is builded badly (Now removed in Patch 1)
* Don’t use the HTML with others device ( PCs, iDevice or Android ) use it only on 6.20 FW on PS4. If you use the HTML on others device nothing’s gonna happen, the exploit won’t run but the structure will run.
